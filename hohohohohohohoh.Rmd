This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Define the data
data <- c(1, 2, 9, 12, 20)

# Compute the dendrogram
dendrogram <- hclust(d = dist(data, method = 'euclidean'), method = 'ward.D')

# Plot the dendrogram
plot(dendrogram,
     main = 'Dendrogram',
     xlab = 'Observations',
     ylab = 'Euclidean distances')

# Cut the dendrogram into 2 clusters
clusters <- cutree(dendrogram, k = 2)

# Print the cluster assignments
print(clusters)

# Add rectangles to the dendrogram to indicate the clusters
rect.hclust(dendrogram, k = 2, border = 2:3)





```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
