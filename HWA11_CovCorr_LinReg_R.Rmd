# Regression

## HWA11 Goals

* Create regression objects (**lm**) with the **lm()** function
* Understand the contents of regression objects and interpret outputs.
* Use the **names()** and **summary()** functions to access specific elements of regression objects.

## Examples (warming up ...)

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
library(yarrr)   #Load the yarrr package for the pirates dataframe
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
# Predict beard.length as a function of sex, age, weight and tattoos

beard_lm <- lm(formula = beard.length ~ sex + age + weight + tattoos,
               data = pirates)

summary(beard_lm)          # Look at summary results
names(beard_lm)            # Named elements in the object
beard_lm$coefficients      # Get coefficients

# Predict tattoos as a function of ALL variables in the pirates dataframe

tattoos_lm <- lm(formula = tattoos ~.,
                 data = pirates)

# Calculate model fits

# Directly from lm object
tattoos_fits <- tattoos_lm$fitted.values

# or calculate manually using predict()
tattoos_fits <- predict(tattoos_lm, newdata = pirates)

# Calculate residuals

# Directly from lm object
tattoos_resid <- tattoos_lm$residuals

# or calculate manually
tattoos_resid <- pirates$tattoos - predict(tattoos_lm, newdata = pirates)
```

## Student Performance

In this HWA11, you will analyze data from a study on student  performance in two classes: math and portuguese.

The data are located in two separate tab-delimited text files in Teams-Files (studentmath.txt --> the math data), and studentpor.txt --> the portugese data).

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).

## Data loading and preparation

1. Create a new PROJECT.

2. Using read.table() load this two data files into R as two objects, one called student_m, and one called student_p.

## Understand the data (1 point)

3. Look at the first few rows of the dataframes with the **head()** and **View()** functions to make sure they loaded correctly.


4. Using the **names()** and **str()** functions, look at the names and structure of the dataframes to make sure everything looks ok. If the data look strange, you did something wrong with **read.table()**, diagnose the problem!

5. Using **write.table()**, save a local copy of the two dataframes to text files called student_m and student_p in the data folder of your project. Now, you’ll always have access to the data.


## Standard Regression with **lm()**
When reporting results from a regression analysis, use the following format: **STATEMENT, b = X, t(df) = X, p = X**: For example:
```{r}
x <- lm(weight ~ Time,
        data = ChickWeight)

summary(x)
```


```{r}
# There is a significant positive relationship between time and weight, b = 8.80, t(576) = 36.73, p < 0.01.
```

## One IV (9 points)

6. For the math data, create a regression object called **lm_6** predicting first period grade (G1) based on age.


7. Run names() and summary() on lm_6 to see additional information from your regression object. Now, return a vector of the coefficients by running **lm_5$coefficients**

8. How do you interpret the relationship between age and first period grade? 

9. By hand (that is, typing the calculation manually), calculate the predicted first period math grade of a student who is 18 years old based on the regression equation (if the coefficient is non-significant, just use it anyway).

10. For the portugese data, create a regression object called lm_10 predicting each student’s period 3 grade (G3) based on their period 1 grade (G1). Look at the results of the regression analysis with summary().

11. What is the relationship between first and third period portugese grades? 

12. By hand, calculate the calculate the predicted third period grade of a student who had a first period grade of 10.


## Regression vs. Correlation (2 points)

13. In task 10 you calculated a regression equation predicting students’ third period portugese grades by their first period grades. Now let’s see if a simple correlation test gives you the same answer. Compare the t-value for this test to the regression analysis you did in question 10. What do you see?

14. Now conduct a correlation test testing the relationship between age and first period grade for the math data. Compare the t-value from this test to the result you obtained in the regression analysis in question 7. What do you see?

## Multiple IVs (3 points)

15. For the math data, create a regression object called lm_15 predicting third period math grade (G3) based on sex, age, internet, and failures. Then, use the summary() function to see a summary table of the output

16. Interpret the results!

17. Create a new regression object called lm_17 using the same variables as question 15, however, this time predict third period scores in the portugese dataset dataset. Use the summary() function to understand the results.

18. What are the key differences between the math and portugese datasets in which variables predict third period scores?

19. Now, create a regression analysis predicting third period portugese grades using all variables in the dataset (Hint: use the notation formula = y ~ . to include all variables!). Which variables are significant? Are any of the variables that were significant before no longer significant.

## Interactions (2 points)

20. Is the relationship between whether or not students go out with friends and period 1 math scores different between the two schools (BP or MS)? Answer this by conducting a regression analysis with the appropriate interaction term.

21. Is the relationship you found above the same for the portugese period 1 grades?

## Predicting values (3 points)

22. For the math dataset, create a regression object called lm_25 predicting a student’s first period math grades based on all variables in the dataset.

23. By looking at the names() of the elements in the lm_25 object, find the vector of fitted values from the regression object. This is a vector of the predicted first period grades of all students based on the regression analysis. Add these predictions as a new column in the student_m dataframe called G1_predicted.

24. On average, how far away were the regression model predictions from the true first period math grades? To answer this, do basic arithmetic operations on the G1 and G1_predicted vectors. You may want to use the abs() function, which will return the absolute value of a vector of values.


25. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between the true first period math grades and the predicted first period math grades. How well does the regression model capture the true first period math grades?

## Simulating results (0 points)

26. In the following code chunk, I will create a dataframe called df that contains four predictors (A, B, C, D) and some random noise (noise). I will then create dv, a dependent variable that is a linear combination of the four predictors, plus the noise. Run the following chunk.


```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
library(tidyverse) # For dplyr

set.seed(100)  # Fix the randomisation

# Create a dataframe with 4 predictors (A, B, C and D) and noise

df <- data.frame(A = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                 B = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                 C = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                 D = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                 noise = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 10))

# Calculate y, a linear combination of A, B, C plus noise

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    dv = 20 + A + 5 * B - 4 * C + 0 * D + noise
  )
```
