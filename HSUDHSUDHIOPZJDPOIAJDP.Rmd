This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
install.packages("kableExtra")
```

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Create a data frame for the table
survival_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("inst", "time", "status", "age", "sex", 
               "ph.ecog", "ph.karno", "pat.karno", "meal.cal", "wt.loss"),
  Description = c(
    "Institution code",
    "Survival time in days",
    "Censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead",
    "Age in years",
    "Male=1 Female=2",
    "ECOG performance score as rated by the physician. \n0=asymptomatic, 1=symptomatic but completely ambulatory, 2=in bed <50% of the day, 3=in bed >50% of the day but not bedbound, 4=bedbound",
    "Karnofsky performance score (bad=0, good=100) rated by physician",
    "Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient",
    "Calories consumed at meals",
    "Weight loss in last six months (pounds)"
  )
)

# Display the table using kableExtra for styling
kable(survival_data, caption = "Description of Variables in the Survival Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), position = "left") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "black") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "30em")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
