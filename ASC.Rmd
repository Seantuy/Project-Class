This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(raster)
input_tif1 <- "H:/Desktop/SPECIES/wc2.1_10m_tmax_ACCESS-CM2_ssp585_2021-2040.tif"
input_tif2 <- "H:/Desktop/SPECIES/wc2.1_10m_tmax_ACCESS-CM2_ssp585_2081-2100.tif"

raster1 <- raster(input_tif1)
raster2 <- raster(input_tif2)

# Set output file paths
output_asc1 <- "H:/Desktop/SPECIES/tmax_2021_2040.asc"
output_asc2 <- "H:/Desktop/SPECIES/tmax_2081_2100.asc"

# Write the rasters to ASCII format
writeRaster(raster1, filename = output_asc1, format = "ascii", overwrite = TRUE)
writeRaster(raster2, filename = output_asc2, format = "ascii", overwrite = TRUE)



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
